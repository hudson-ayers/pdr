When you think aobut Tony Bennett, you probably don't think much about offense. Instead,
you probably think about his impenetrable pack line defense, or perhaps his dashing good looks.
The attention given to Tony Bennett's defensive prowess has distracted public opinion from
his coaching abilities on the offensive end. Here, I present evidence that Tony Bennett is the greatest
3-Point shot coach of all time.

## Exhibit A

The first evidence that Tony Bennett might be a good 3-point shot coach is his own shooting
prowess. Tony Bennett holds the NCAA record for 3-pt% (min 200 attempts),
hitting an incredible 49.7% of his shots over his 4 year career as a player at the University
of Wisconsin-Green Bay.

## Exhibit B

When conducting an analysis such as this, many might be tempted to analyze how well
Tony Bennett's players have shot while playing for him in the NCAA, and compare that
to how well other coaches player's have shot underneath them. Indeed, an accounting 
of Tony Bennett's current and recent  players reveals several excellent shooters in Kyle Guy (50% from 3 in 2016/17),
Ty Jerome(40% from 3 in 2016/17), and London Perrantes(49% from 3 in 2015/16). 
However, this analysis could be flawed -- the 3-pt% of
a team might be attributable more to offensive scheme than to player shooting ability.
To determine how effective a coach is at developing shooters, it is useful to look at how well
TB-coached players shoot for other teams, a mechanism which separates scheme from shooting ability
by distributing the statistics across a number of offensive schemes.

To do so, we can look at how well Tony Bennett coached players shoot in the NBA (data collected 11/6):

### Takeaways

This year, TB coached players are shooting at a combined 45% clip from 3 on almost 200 attempts,
despite Klay shooting 6% below his career average. This alone is pretty incredible.

TB coached players are 40% overall since 2010, a remarkable clip especially considering Justin 
Anderson shot almost 600 3s in that span.
