When most people think aobut Tony Bennett, they do not think about offense. Instead,
most focus on his pack line defense, or perhaps his dashing good looks. However, the
attention given to Tony Bennett's defensive prowess has distracted public opinion from
his abilities on the offensive end. Here, I present evidence that Tony Bennett is the greatest
3-Point shot coach of all time.

## Exhibit A

The first evidence that Tony Bennett might be a good 3-point shot coach is his own shooting
prowess. Tony Bennett holds the NCAA record for 3-pt% (min 200 attempts),
hitting an incredible 49.7% of his shots over his 4 year career.

## Exhibit B

When conducting an analysis such as this, many might be tempted to analyze how well
Tony Bennett's players have shot while playing for him in the NCAA, and compare that
to how well other coaches player's have shot underneath them. Indeed, an accounting 
of Tony Bennett's current players reveals several excellent shooters in Kyle Guy,
Ty Jerome, and Deandre Hunter. However, this analysis could be flawed -- the 3-pt% of
a team might be attributable more to offensive scheme than to player shooting ability.
To determine how effective a coach is at developing shooters, it is useful to look at how well
TB-coached players shoot for other teams, a mechanism which separates scheme from shooting ability
by distributing the statistics across a number of offensive schemes.

To do so, we can look at how well Tony Bennett coached players shoot in the NBA:

### Takeaways

This year, TB coached players are shooting at a combined 45% clip from 3 on almost 200 attempts,
despite Klay shooting 6% below his career average.

TB coached players are 40% overall since 2010, a remarkable clip especially considering Justin 
Anderson shot almost 600 3s in that span.
